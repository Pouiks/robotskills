    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about the domestic robot market",
    "questions": {
      "marketSize": {
        "question": "What is the real size of the domestic robot market today?",
        "answer": "The global domestic robot market is estimated between $10 and $14 billion in 2024-2025 according to several research firms. This value is mainly driven by utility robots, particularly robot vacuums, which account for the majority of sales and revenue in the segment."
      },
      "growth": {
        "question": "Is the domestic robot market really growing rapidly?",
        "answer": "Yes, the domestic robot market is experiencing sustained growth, with an estimated compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20%. This growth mainly concerns the expansion of existing segments like cleaning robots, rather than mass adoption of versatile domestic robots."
      },
      "households": {
        "question": "How many domestic robots are actually present in households?",
        "answer": "Estimates indicate that approximately 40 million domestic robots could be present in households worldwide around 2025, and more than 50 million units by 2027. This volume remains low compared to other common household equipment, confirming the still marginal nature of the market."
      },
      "types": {
        "question": "What types of domestic robots actually dominate the market?",
        "answer": "The most common domestic robots are specialized robots, such as vacuums and floor washers, autonomous lawn mowers, and pool robots. These categories concentrate most of the adoption and revenue, while more complex robots remain marginal."
      },
      "niche": {
        "question": "Why do domestic robots remain niche products despite market growth?",
        "answer": "Domestic robots remain niche products because their use value is limited to specific tasks, their cost remains high, and their reliability decreases when uses become complex. For most households, these products are not yet perceived as essential."
      },
      "limits": {
        "question": "What are the main technological limitations of current domestic robots?",
        "answer": "The main technological limitations concern object manipulation in unstructured environments, understanding the domestic context, and safety in the presence of humans. These constraints explain why domestic robots avoid complex physical interactions."
      },
      "cost": {
        "question": "What is the real long-term cost of a domestic robot?",
        "answer": "The real cost of a domestic robot includes the purchase price, maintenance, spare parts, software updates, and sometimes cloud subscriptions. Over several years, the total cost of ownership can far exceed the initial investment."
      },
      "mainstream": {
        "question": "When will domestic robots really become mainstream?",
        "answer": "Domestic robots will become mainstream when three conditions are met: clear use value, controlled safety, and accessible cost. In the short and medium term, the market will evolve mainly through gradual improvement of specialized robots."
